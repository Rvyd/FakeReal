#Real vs Fake Face Classifier (PyTorch)
This project uses a pretrained ResNet101 model to classify face images as real or fake. Transfer learning is applied for efficient training.

Features
Image preprocessing and data augmentation

Model training and testing

Single image prediction

Model saving and loading

Requirements
Python 3.x, PyTorch, torchvision, Pillow

Usage
Train and test the model

Predict on individual images

Description
The model is trained for 5 epochs and achieves high accuracy distinguishing real from fake faces. The project includes data loading, training, evaluation, and inference steps.
